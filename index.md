# About
I have been in the Cybersecurity industry for over a decade and decided to use this platform as a way to showcase some of my personal Cybersecurity projects while creating opportunities for collaboratiaon via the Github and open-source software community.

My favorite thing about Cybersecurity is the constant cat and mouse game that exists between attackers and defenders. While I have experience creating both red and blue team software applications, my passion lies on the detection side of defensive Cybersecurity. My goal is to take the conceptual thoughts I have in my head and turn them into tangible projects that allow me to learn the newest technologies while staying relevant in the fast paced world of Cybersecurity.

## Project - Operating System Bootloader and x86 kernel, May 2023 - Present
This project creates a minimal operating system loader utilizing the UEFI Development Kit (EDK2) that loads a file from a storage location into memory and passes control to it. This file happens to be my own x86 operating system kernel that is in the very early stages of development.
