# About
I have been in the Cybersecurity industry for over a decade and wanted to use this platform as a way to showcase some of my personal Cybersecurity projects while creating opportunities for collaboration via the Github and open-source Cybersecurity community.

My favorite thing about Cybersecurity is the constant cat and mouse game that exists between attackers and defenders. From my experience as a software developer and Cybersecurity engineer, I have found detection engineering to be one of my strong suits. My goal is to take the conceptual thoughts I have in my head and turn them into tangible projects that allow me to learn the newest technologies while staying relevant in this rapidly changing field.

## Project - Operating System Bootloader and x86 kernel, May 2023 - Present
This project creates a minimal operating system loader utilizing the UEFI Development Kit (EDK2) that loads a file from a storage location into memory and passes control to it. This file happens to be my own x86 operating system kernel that is in the very early stages of development.
